\title{Create an individual plot for each name(WELL/FIELD/GROUP) and keyword, with multiple cases on each plot.}
\usage{
PlotEach(longdata, casenames = NULL, wgnames = NULL, keywords = NULL,
  basecase = NULL, ncolumns = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{longdata}{A long format summary dataframe, not the csv file stored with each simulation case output.  This may be either the output of the eclsum function, or the file "REPORTS/PROJSUM.csv".}

\item{casenames}{A list with casenames to be plotted.  Default is all casenames in the dataframe.}

\item{wgnames}{A list with well/group/field names to be plotted.  Default is all WELL/FIELD/GROUP names in the dataframe.}

\item{keywords}{A list with parameters to be plotted, e.g. "WOPR".  Default is all keywords in the dataframe.}

\item{basecase}{The case against which all others will be compared.}

\item{ncolumns}{How many columns of plots to display.  The default is a display 3 columns wide, with as many rows as necessary to plot all of the desired plots.}
}
\description{
This function accepts a long format dataframe as input, and creates plots using ggplot
}
\details{
The intent of this function is to compare multiple runs (i.e. "cases") on the same plot.  With too many cases, the plot will quickly become illegible, so a reasonable selection should be made.
